% Ensemble Classification | June 2013 | version 2.0 | TESTING ROUTINE
% -------------------------------------------------------------------------
% INPUT:
%  - X - testing features (in a row-by-row manner)
%  - trained_ensemble - trained ensemble - cell array of individual base
%              learners (output of the 'ensemble_training' routine)
% OUTPUT:
%  - results.predictions - individual cover (-1) and stego (+1) predictions
%              based on the majority voting scheme
%  - results.votes - sum of all votes (gives some information about
%              prediction confidence)
